This repository stores all my work regarding the Etna Township Dataset. The Etna Township report is a project based on a survey conducted by The Etna Township Trustees to help guide the creation of the Township's next comprehensive plan. The data is gathered from a survey aimed at Etna Township's residents. 

The report then will be pitched to the representatives of Etna Township during the Big Red Data competition, which is a chance for us to demonstrate our ideas to develop Etna Township. We hope to have our ideas implemented into the comprehensive plan.

Update: Our team won Best Visualization at the Big Red Data competition!
