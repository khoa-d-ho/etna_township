Also, all this publicity concerning discord in our Township is embarassing! Do better Etna...DO BETTER! "

Instead Trustees and county officials decided that western Etna Township would be the dumping ground for warehouses and their loud, fume-belching semis. They're easy to put up, especially when they egregiously cut corners, and produce traffic, noise and air quality problems. Tax abatements for these companies are a joke. Question number 6 might still pertain to people who live in areas 4 & 5, but they DON'T exist in 1, 2 or 3 anymore. The trustees have never listened to the residents in the western half of the township, and our property values and quality of life have suffered because of it. Now we're much more like the south end of Columbus or Obetz. "

Now all the amazon vans and tractor trailers plug mink and rt40 intersection. But another political lie was told to the residents just to get it built. Your meetings and surveys mean nothing if you say your going to do one thing and then ignore your residents and do the other. Amazon traffic should not be allowed to enter or exit onto mink rd. As should no other future building being built. As there is a road fir that purpose behind the amazon and Ashley.

Its okay and good to being transparent, but Evans takes it to far. Somthing is wrong when one is always  fighting with 2 other Trustee's and you see the lack of respect for each other and the residents.  You have 3 Trustee's 2 seem to want to work through project 1 seems to have his own adjenda to be at odds with the other 2. This is a lack of Respect to the Residents of Etna who supported the other 2 and hoped they voted for 3 who they thought  would  work as one for the people. Somene will need to go in the future election."

Like Pataskala downtown.  A community where you can easily walk to retail.  Like the old Etna Market but better. Keep it clean, area low lighting, signs low, with a specific look.  Pataskala has done a nice job.  Parking area for commuters. Shopping places that attract. Specialty stores. Outlet Mall if a mall at all.  ",,,,,,,Relaxing zoning within town of Etna for mom & pop shops. ,Yes,Very,Very,Somewhat,Very,Very,,Broadband Internet,,,Recycling,,,,,Recycling,,,Improve Schools,,,,,,Other (please specify),"Utilize existing money from JEDZ, current taxes, Fed and State grants, free money. ",Very important,Yes,,"Flooding when it rains. Need to fix the open ditches by laying pipe and making proper drainage systems, especially in known road flood zones.  Ditches are dirty not maintained properly in rural settings harbor raw sewage from old septic systems.  Once piping is laid filled and covered it would be easily maintained esthetically by homeowner mowing. Water can end up in water and sewer district to be turned into clean drinking water.  Our ditches are terrible even in not flood areas would look better piped and covered.  Easier to maintain mowing for township. Would eliminate some mowing.  Also, tell Trustees to work together, stop holding meetings without other trustees, get along and be equals. "

Good schools should also be at the heart as this will attract the right kind of families. If we are annexed by Reynoldsburg and put in Reynoldsburg schools, we will move. I also feel terrible for people who now live across from big warehouses. Any additional warehouses should be built in the backyards of people who let them come in the first place."
